# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview
Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests
Run project's test suite. If tests fail, stop and fix before proceeding.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch
```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Present Options
```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally
Switch to base, pull latest, merge, verify tests, delete feature branch.

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR
Push branch, create PR with summary and test plan.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is
Report branch name and worktree location. Don't cleanup.

#### Option 4: Discard
Confirm first with typed 'discard' confirmation. Then delete branch.

## Quick Reference
| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Red Flags
**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
