It is absolutely crucial to get the branding right for the new CA India logo, as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has strict, government-backed regulations for its usage. Since the one-year transition period that started in November 2023 has passed, full compliance is now mandatory across all professional materials.

Here is the comprehensive, strictly regulated brand guideline system for the logo.

## The "Do's" (Allowed & Required)
These are the structural and symbolic requirements you must adhere to when placing the logo on letterheads, visiting cards, websites, and digital platforms.

*   **Maintain the Exact Design:** You must use the complete design exactly as issued: the blue 'CA', the upside-down tricolor tick mark, and the word 'INDIA'.
*   **Preserve the White Background:** The logo is not transparent. It must always include its solid white background block, regardless of the color of the stationary or website it is placed on.
*   **Keep Original Proportions:** The font (boldness, size), spacing, and exact dimensions between the letters and the tick mark must remain completely unaltered.

**Respect the Symbolism:** Ensure the logo is placed prominently to reflect its intended meaning:
*   The Blue denotes creativity, integrity, stability, divinity, immortality, bravery, and determination.
*   The Tricolor Tick symbolizes the wisdom of the professional, while hinting at motion, progress, unity, and diversity.
*   The word "INDIA" represents the institute's "India First" approach and commitment to serving the national economy.

## The "Don'ts" (Strictly Not Okay)
Any deviation from the original file provided by the ICAI is a violation of the usage guidelines.

*   **No Color Changes:** Do not invert the colors, change the hex codes, or attempt to make the logo greyscale or black-and-white.
*   **No Background Removal:** Do not make the white background transparent to let your website or paper color show through.
*   **No Rotation or Tilting:** The logo must sit perfectly flat. Do not tilt it clockwise or counter-clockwise for artistic effect.
*   **No Distortion:** Do not stretch, compress, shrink, or shear the logo. If you need to resize it, you must scale it proportionally so the aspect ratio never changes.
*   **No Cropping:** Do not crop out the word 'INDIA' or the tricolor tick mark to use the 'CA' in isolation.
*   **No Font Substitutions:** Do not try to recreate the logo by typing "CA INDIA" in a similar font. You must use the official graphic file.
